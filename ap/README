The XML generator script will use paths RELATIVE to whatever your FG_ROOT
directory is. There are actually multiple places this could be, and it will
depend on how you installed FlightGear. The following link has more
information:

	https://wiki.flightgear.org/$FG_ROOT

After you've found that directory, you will need to do a recursive copy of the
parent model directories:

	# cp -R M1 $FG_ROOT/Models/Military
	# cp -R T72 $FG_ROOT/Models/Military

It is also possible on Linux to use the ".fgfs" directory FlightGear uses to
download models dynamically.

	# cp -R M1 /home/user/.fgfs/Models/Military
	# cp -R T72 /home/user/.fgfs/Models/Military
